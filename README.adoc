= Image Bakery

This project is focused on creating reproducible images of all kinds (vm, docker, tarballs for writing directly to metal, etc.)
This project uses a combination of virt-builder, disk-imagebuilder, docker, and other tools to achieve these goals.
The format for defining an image build is still unstable and very much a work in progress, so the ugly direct-to-ci hack is just being used for testing purposes.
Note that your runner must expose /dev/kvm to the job, or else it will be painfully slow (this means running a docker container in privileged mode, adding your runner job user to the kvm group,
or somehow otherwise exposing /dev/kvm to your job as appropriate.)

  custom_script: |
      ## This script will be passed directly into the native shell of your image as the last step
      ## Use this to do things like set grub boot times, force predictable udev names, load kernel modules, etc.
